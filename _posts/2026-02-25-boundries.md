  A servant’s heart still needs God-given boundaries. Learn the difference
  between serving from love and over-functioning from fear.

🌱 *“Willingness without boundaries turns into resentment.”*

Are you a “yes” person?

Do you have the heart of a servant?

Have you ever told yourself your constant willingness was “just kindness” — but deep down you’re exhausted?

Have you noticed that your willingness isn’t always reciprocated… and now you feel left out, lonely, or emotionally drained?

I can ask question after question on this topic because this is a vulnerable area for me.

I am a YES person.

I will do whatever I can for anyone — because I truly have a servant’s heart. I love helping others. I love showing up. I love being dependable.

And there is nothing wrong with that.

But I learned something the hard way…

When you don’t carry boundaries and discernment with your “yes,” your willingness quietly turns into resentment.

Not overnight.
Not loudly.
But silently.

## Serving From Love vs. Over-Functioning From Fear

There is a difference between:

- Serving from love
- Over-functioning from fear

Serving from love feels light.
Over-functioning from fear feels heavy.

**Fear says:**

- “If I say no, they won’t need me.”
- “If I don’t help, I’ll disappoint them.”
- “If I step back, I might be left out.”

**Love says:**

- “I choose to give.”
- “My yes fulfills me.”
- “I can’t wait to do this again.”
- “Lord, I want more like this.”

One flows from alignment.
The other flows from anxiety.

## Signs Your Willingness Is Being Abused

If your willingness has shifted from healthy to harmful, you may notice:

- You feel drained instead of fulfilled
- Your “yes” feels heavy
- People expect your help but rarely reciprocate
- You feel anxious about saying no
- You secretly feel resentful — but don’t want to admit it

Resentment is often the fruit of misplaced responsibility.

And here’s the truth:

A servant’s heart still needs God-given boundaries.

You are called to love — not to lose yourself in your yes.

## What God Anointed You For

God anoints you to:

- Love
- Serve
- Reflect Christ
- Walk in obedience

He does **not** anoint you to carry what He never assigned to you.

Let that sink in.

Sometimes we are exhausted not because we are obedient…
But because we are over-responsible.

> “Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”
> — 1 Peter 4:10 (NIV)

A steward manages what is assigned.

Not everything is assigned to you.

## Anointing or Over-Responsibility?

If this hits your heart, it may be time to reevaluate what God has actually assigned to you.

Ask yourself honestly:

- Am I operating in anointing… or over-responsibility?
- Is this obedience… or fear of disappointing someone?
- Am I giving from overflow… or from depletion?

And then pray.

Ask God what you need to lay down.

Because sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do
is say no.

If you’re learning how to carry your servant’s heart without carrying unnecessary weight, you’re not alone.

Healing often begins not with doing more —
but with discerning what was never yours to carry.
