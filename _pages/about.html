  heading: About Living Proof
  paragraph: "The heart behind "Living Proof" Hi, I'm Monica, Wife, Mother and firm Believer of Jesus Christ. The real truth is, Living Proof was birthed from my own testimonies. There was a time in my life when I felt the weight of brokenness - in relationships, In my identity, and in repetitive cycles I didn't know how to break. I understood what it felt like to survive, but not truly live. I knew what it meant to Love deeply, but struggled with boundaries, I knew what it felt like to want healing.. but not know where to start. And slowly, through surrender, growth, accountability, and Gods relentless grace everything began to shift. Through my own transformation I discovered that healing is possible when we address the mind, body , and spirit together. "Living Proof" isn’t just a name - it’s my testimony and the representation for so many other's"
