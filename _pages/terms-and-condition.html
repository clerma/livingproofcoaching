        <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3">1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms & Conditions govern your use of Living Proof Faith-Based Wellness Coaching (“Living Proof,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and all coaching services, content, and materials provided through this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing this website or purchasing coaching services, you agree to these terms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">2. Coaching Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          Living Proof provides faith-based wellness coaching focused on personal growth, spiritual development, and holistic well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coaching is not therapy, medical care, psychological counseling, or legal advice. We do not diagnose or treat medical or mental health conditions. If you are experiencing a medical or mental health crisis, please seek care from a licensed professional.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">3. Personal Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that you are fully responsible for your decisions, actions, and results. Coaching provides support, guidance, and tools — but implementation and outcomes depend on your participation and commitment.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">4. Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          All coaching sessions, programs, and digital offerings must be paid in full unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of coaching services and digital content, all sales are final unless otherwise stated in a written agreement.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">5. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          We respect your privacy. Information shared during coaching sessions will remain confidential except where disclosure is required by law or where there is risk of harm to yourself or others.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          All content on this website — including text, graphics, programs, downloads, and materials — is the property of Living Proof and may not be copied, distributed, or reproduced without written permission.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">7. Website Use</h2>
